         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It reſteth now that we carefully collect, the ſcattered frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our dull meditations, and take a view what wee have obſerved, from the precept of our Saviour, and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon annexed, in the firſt we conſidered his oecumenicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in deſigning to his ſervants this gathering employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo their humility, and dutifull obedience, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his precept, in the work impoſed.</p>
               <p>In collecting we conſidered temporall neceſſaries, as the literall ſence of this frugall precept, and then by an argument from the leſſe to the greater, we inferred the neceſſity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall proviſion, firſt ſacred precepts, of piety and charity, directing our active and paſſive obedience, then promiſes purging, pardoning, and healing, ſalves fit to cure each wound of the ſoul, laſtly, wee gathered up ſundry obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to view in them the condition of the godly, in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions, miraculous deliverances, and various revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into different eſtates.</p>
               <p>In the reaſon we conſidered how an abſolute agent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to the weakneſſe of our ſhallow capacity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding our benefit as a ſpeciall motive, inducing to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his ſacred precept, ſith every one ſayth, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> and laments the loſſe of what was but lent him, which illuſtrates the uſefulneſſe of this frugall precept, and annexed reaſon <hi>that nothing be loſt.</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113997:45"/> becauſe wee are accountants for the talent of our maſter, wherewith we muſt trade that it may not be loſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, a caution was tendred unto us, that we loſe not our ſelves in the labyrinth of errour, into which we fall, when we wander from our way, when wee walk in darkneſſe, or are wrong miſled, and when we refuſe that infallible guide, the ſacred Scriptures, that might lead us ſafely, we ſodainly erre both from truth and peace, and turn into by-ways which render us loſt.</p>
               <p>Our compaſſionate Saviour whoſe miraculous mercy, hath been the matter of our poor Meditations, vouchſafe us the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his ſanctifying ſpirit, both to know and do what his word directs us, that our judgments being informed by the light of his truth, and our lives reformed from all ſinfull obliquity, we may gratefully conſecrate all to his prayſe,<note place="margin">
